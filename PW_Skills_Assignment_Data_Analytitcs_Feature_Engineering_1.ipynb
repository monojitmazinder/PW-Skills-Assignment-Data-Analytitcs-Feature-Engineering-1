For example, ice cream sales and drowning deaths may increase together (positive correlation), but eating ice cream doesn’t cause drowning. The actual cause is a third factor—hot weather. So, while correlation may suggest a link, causation proves it. Understanding this difference is key to making accurate conclusions from data."
